# AQI-Calculator

•	Developed an Air Quality Index Calculator using Python that accurately determines the air quality based on the pollutant data supplied to the software and produces an output in accordance with the algorithm.

•	The program invokes a specific formula for each valid pollutant type, by mapping the name with the data stored in dictionary data structure when the function is called.

•	The Input data is handled by several validators who check for the valid data entries and covers numerous edge cases. Output is delivered with cumulative calculation of all the pollutants and Advisory is produced as output.
